## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Iâ€™m the creator of [WebODM](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM), [LibreTranslate](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate) and co-founder of [OpenDroneMap](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap). I earn a living working independently on open source software full time.

I specialize in geospatial and drone software development, with a focus on computer vision and AI.

Iâ€™m an advocate of open source software as a commercially sustainable business model. I think itâ€™s a direct expression of the [Constructal Law](https://mems.duke.edu/impact/research/energy/bejan-constructal-law/).
